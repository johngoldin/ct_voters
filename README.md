This is a look at CT voter registrations from [connvoters.com](http://connvoters.com).

The [connvoters.com](http://connvoters.com) redisplays information on Connecticut voters purchased from 
the [State of Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/SOTS/Election-Services/Election-Services/Centralized-Voter-Registration-Information). Its pages have a lot of ads, but it is also easy to download the actual data.

Code here is just some experimentation with this data.
